# Hello! this is the repo for my personal portfolio.

It's made with:

- React
- Tailwind
- Vite
- Deploy in Vercel

This is the initial configuration, in the next days I hope to find myself with a beautiful design to share with you.

## Local development

Install dependencies and start the dev server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Create a `.env` file using the template provided in `.env.template` to configure the EmailJS integration.

## Improvements

The layout now includes a floating **scroll to top** button and a sticky navigation bar for a smoother browsing experience.
